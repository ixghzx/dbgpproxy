# dbgpproxy

To build the app, you need to install Haskell Stack. For more information see https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

When the stack is installed, run 
./build

If the build process completes successfully, the binary dbhproxy is located in `./.stack-work/install` firectory.

To run the app, the config file `config.yaml` must be in the current directory.
